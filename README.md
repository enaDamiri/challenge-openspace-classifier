The Mission
Your company moved to a new office. It's an openspace with 6 tables of 4 seats. As many of you are new colleagues, you come up with the idea of changing seats everyday and get to know each other better by working side by side with your new colleagues.

You will create a program that runs everyday to re-assign everybody to a new seat.
